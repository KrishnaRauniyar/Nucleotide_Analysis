## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

To get started with the `Common Key Calculation`, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaRauniyar/Nucleotide_Analysis.git
cd common_key_package
```

### Installing the Package
1. It's recommended to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv tsrenv
source tsrenv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
tsrenv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Analyzing Common Keys
For common key calculation run the following command:

```python
python common_keys.py --path input_dir
```
The input_dir is a directory which holds the input triplet files. The common keys will be calculated between all the triplet files generated by the key_triplets TSR package. You can give the direct path to the key_triplet files directory in the TSR package or make a new directory and place all the files in it.

### CSV file information as output (common_keys.csv)
A csv file common_keys.csv will be genrated in a following format.

| fileName      | total_keys | common_keys | sum_common_keys_freq   | 
|---------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1_1TSR_E_DT   | 4          | 0           | 0                      |
| 1_2AC0_E_DC   | 1          | 0           | 0                      |

File name are all the triplets files in the input_dir. We have total_keys, common_keys and sum_common_keys_freq which contains total number of keys in each triplet files, common keys in all the triplet files and sum of all the triplet keys which are common respectively.
